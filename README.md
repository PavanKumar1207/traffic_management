## Overview

Traffic congestion is a significant challenge in urban areas, leading to inefficiencies and pollution. Our Intelligent Traffic Management System addresses this by analyzing real-time traffic data to:

- Dynamically adjust traffic signal timings based on vehicle density.
- Monitor traffic congestion through a dashboard.
- Alert drivers about traffic updates and suggest alternative routes.

## Features

1. *Real-Time Vehicle Density Detection*  
   - Uses computer vision to count vehicles in each lane using cameras at intersections.
   - Dynamically adjusts traffic signal waiting times.

2. *Congestion Monitoring Dashboard*  
   - Visualizes vehicle counts, traffic density, and congestion levels.
   - Displays real-time traffic updates and traffic flow predictions.

3. *Mobile Alerts for Drivers*  
   - Notifies users about congestion ahead.
   - Suggests alternative routes using the Google Maps API.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python (Flask/Django)
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (Optional for deep learning models)

### Frontend
- React.js or Vue.js
- Plotly.js / D3.js (Visualizations)

### APIs
- Google Maps API (for traffic and route information)

### Tools
